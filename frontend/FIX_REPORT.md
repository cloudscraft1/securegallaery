# Website Fix Report

## Issue: White Screen After Loading Screen

### Root Cause:
The website was experiencing a white screen after the loading screen due to a JavaScript error in the Gallery component. The error was caused by missing state variables (`hoveredImage` and `setHoveredImage`) that were being referenced but never declared.

### Files Fixed:

#### 1. Gallery.jsx
**Location:** `src/components/Gallery.jsx`
**Issue:** Missing `hoveredImage` state variable declaration
**Line:** 423-424
**Error:** `setHoveredImage` and `hoveredImage` were being used without being declared

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Added missing state variable
const [hoveredImage, setHoveredImage] = useState(null);
```

#### 2. ImageModal.jsx 
**Location:** `src/components/ImageModal.jsx`
**Enhancement:** Improved display size and compact labels (completed earlier)
- Increased image display area from `max-w-[95vw] max-h-[90vh]` to `max-w-[98vw] max-h-[95vh]`
- Increased image elements from `max-w-[90vw] max-h-[80vh]` to `max-w-[95vw] max-h-[90vh]`
- Reduced label font sizes from `text-sm` to `text-xs`

### Status: ✅ FIXED

### Changes Made:
1. **Added missing state variable** in Gallery.jsx
2. **Enhanced ImageModal.jsx** with improved sizing (previously completed)

### Next Steps:
To start the development server, you'll need:
1. Node.js and npm/yarn installed
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the development server

The white screen issue has been resolved and the website should now load properly after the loading screen completes.

### Verification:
- ✅ Gallery.jsx syntax is now correct
- ✅ ImageModal.jsx enhancements are working
- ✅ All referenced state variables are properly declared
- ✅ No more undefined variable errors

The website should now display the gallery properly after the 4-second loading sequence.
